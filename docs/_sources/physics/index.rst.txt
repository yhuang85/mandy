Physics
=======

After spending many years as a mathematician, I found out that I'm actually more attracted by physics because it's all about the real world around us, rather than some imaginary abstractions. Physical theories, just like mathematical ones, can be very complex and abstract. But unlike mathematical theories, all physical theories must ultimately be tested against Nature, and only then it can bear some value -- it's completely irrelevant how "beautiful" the theory might look.

As a complete beginner, who is trying to teach himself this huge subject, some note-taking is certainly helpful for my own sanity. This is indeed the main, if not the only, purpose of the following posts.
